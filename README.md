# Project Overview

This project converts a given CSV file into a set of backend APIs, providing a structured and accessible way to interact with the data. The backend APIs are hosted on **[Render](https://render.com/)**.

## Features Implemented

- **CSV to API Conversion**: The provided CSV data has been successfully transformed into accessible APIs.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented sign-in functionality.
- **Store Management**: Added the functionality to add a store.
- **Cypress Testing**: Conducted Cypress testing for the Sign-In component to ensure reliability.

## Backend API

The APIs are hosted at:

ðŸ”— **Base URL:** [https://gsynergy-backend.onrender.com](https://gsynergy-backend.onrender.com)

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint      | Method | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `/stores` | GET   | Get all store data       |
| `/skus` | GET   | Get all sku data                     |
| `/chart`   | GET    | Get all  chart data |
| `/planning`   | GET    | Get all  planning data |
| `/calculations`   | GET    | Get all  calculations data |



## Testing

Cypress testing has been performed for the **Sign-In** component to ensure proper authentication flow and prevent regressions.
